# utils folder

1. The folder contains files that either contain function that are shared between multiple files or functions / 
   configs that I wanted to store somewhere else to keep my react-components clean and small

2. `losses.js` was used first as a local database and all data was imported from this file.
After that the project got its own database. But I left the `losses.js` file just in case one needs it (not idea for 
what reason, just in case).
